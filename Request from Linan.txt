        "lesson": "lesson that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "topic": "topic that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "seab": "seab_subtopic that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "subject": "subject that the checkpoint belongs to"
    },
    {
        "title": "title of the checkpoint",
        "description": "description for the checkpoint",
        "lecturer": "name of the lecturer",

        "seab": "seab_subtopic that the checkpoint belongs to",

        "description": "description for the checkpoint",
        "lecturer": "name of the lecturer",
        "url": "YouTube URL of the checkpoint",
        "lesson": "lesson that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "topic": "topic that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "seab": "seab_subtopic that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "subject": "subject that the checkpoint belongs to"
    }

2. Add new checkpoint by taking JSON
POST request sending you a String of the following format

[
    {
        "title": "title of the checkpoint",
        "description": "description for the checkpoint",
        "lecturer": "name of the lecturer",
        "url": "YouTube URL of the checkpoint",
        "lesson": "lesson that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "topic": "topic that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "seab": "seab_subtopic that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "subject": "subject that the checkpoint belongs to"
        "order": "numbering of the checkpoint within the LESSON"
    },
    {
        "title": "title of the checkpoint",
        "description": "description for the checkpoint",
        "lecturer": "name of the lecturer",
        "url": "YouTube URL of the checkpoint",
        "lesson": "lesson that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "topic": "topic that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "seab": "seab_subtopic that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "subject": "subject that the checkpoint belongs to"
        "order": "numbering of the checkpoint within the LESSON"

    },
    {
        "title": "title of the checkpoint",
        "description": "description for the checkpoint",
        "lecturer": "name of the lecturer",
        "url": "YouTube URL of the checkpoint",
        "lesson": "lesson that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "topic": "topic that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "seab": "seab_subtopic that the checkpoint belongs to",
        "subject": "subject that the checkpoint belongs to"

    }
