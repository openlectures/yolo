    {subject_id:"1", topic: "Market System", description:"This theme provides an introduction to the nature of economics and examines the operation of markets for goods and services. It also focuses on how consumers and producers make decisions about the choices they face, recognising that in the market economy, both are motivated by self-interest. You should be able to understand the price mechanism as a means of allocating resources and be able to apply demand and supply analysis to real world situations."},
    {subject_id:"1", topic: "Market Failure and Government Intervention", description:"This theme examines the nature of market failure, its causes and possible policy remedies. You should be able to understand why markets may not allocate resources efficiently and the methods of dealing with market failure, together with an evaluation of their effectiveness."},
    {subject_id:"1", topic: "National and International Economy", description: "This theme provides an introduction to the key indicators of economic performance, the basic AD/AS and AE-Income analysis, and  the main objectives and instruments of government policy. You should be able to acquire a good knowledge of recent economic trends and developments in Singapore and the international economy. You should also be able to appreciate the possible underlying causes of these trends and developments and to evaluate the effectiveness of government policies in the light of these events."},
    {subject_id:"5", topic: "Measurement", description: "In this prelude to actual physics, the Measurement theme provides a sound foundation to the mathematical work of physics. Here, SI Units are introduced along with their accessory prefixes and suffixes, the errors and uncertainties that may occur in a measurement delineated, and scalars and vectors described."},
    {subject_id:"5", topic: "Newtonian Mechanics", description:"Newtonian mechanics serves as the de facto introduction to classical physics. Here, we explore kinematics and dynamics, forces and their resulting work done, energy, and power. Circular motion and gravitation are explained, and rounded off with oscillatory phenomena."},
    {subject_id:"5", topic: "Thermal Physics", description: "Thermal physics concerns itself with the internal energy of materials, in latent heat and heat capacities. You will learn of the different temperature scales and the thermodynamic temperature's connection to a molecule's kinetic energy, the 1st law of thermodynamics, and the ideal gas equation."},
    {subject_id:"5", topic: "Waves", description:"Waves underpin the bulk of physical phenomena. This theme explains wave motion, and the superposition of waves, which will help you to understand the many and varied intricacies of higher level physics."},
    {subject_id:"5", topic: "Electricity and Magnetism", description:"The E&M theme explores electric fields, electric currents, and direct current (D.C.) circuits. It then goes on to reveal the Januslike nature of E&M, EM induction, and finally to talk about alternating current (A.C.) circuits."},
    {subject_id:"5", topic: "Modern Physics", description: "The Modern Physics theme provides an overview to the advancements in physics in the 20th century, and beyond. Here, you will receive a primer on the weirdness of quantum mechanics, its applications to lasers and semiconductors, and unlock the many secrets of the atomic nucleus."},

    {subject_id:"9", topic: "Paper 1: Essay", description: "Among twelve different essay prompts, GP students have to choose one and express their views in a critical and creative manner. Here, we will be sharing tips and strategies pertinent to writing a good argumentative essay."},
    {subject_id:"9", topic: "Paper 2: Comprehension", description: "Paper 2 comprises of comprehension questions, a summary and an application question. The goal is to assess how well you are able to explain, infer, evaluate and summarise information from a given passage. We will be covering the various skills required to tackle these types of questions in the following lectures"}
